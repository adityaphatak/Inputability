		When using a pointer device entry is accomplished by clicking
		the key corresponding to the letter or number you want to produce.
		</p>
		<p>
		Modifier keys like shift are sticky.  A single click latches it.<br>

		This sets the modifier on for the duration of one click on an ordinary key.<br>
		</p><p>
		A further click locks the modifier.<br>
		<img src="locked.png"><br>
		This keeps the modifier active until a further click on that modifier.
		</p>

			Further keys can be accessed by clicking the coloured tabs down the right hand side.
